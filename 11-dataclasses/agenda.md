# Data Classes

When writing games it's easier to put all variables and functions related to any specific object in its own box. In python we call this box a Data Class

## Getting To Know the Starter Code - Part 1

1. Run the starter program. See the white square moving from side to side

2. Looking only at the code in the second part (below line 23):

  - Note the variable bar taking the special value RightLeftBar()
  - Note how we call the functions bar.update() and bar.draw() inside draw() function

3. Crate another square that will run from right to left somewhere else on the screen

4. And a third one

## Simple Tasks
5. Let's look at the first part of the code (lines 1-24)

6. It is a DEFINITION of a new thing in Python - A Class!

7. A class glues together logic and data related to a single "thing" on screen

8. Change the value 2 into 4 in lines 8 and 15. Notice how all the squared we created now have the new speed

9. Change the size of the rectangle. Notice how all the rectangles now have the new size.

10. Try to change the color of the rectangles, so each will have a different color


## More Complex Task
Create a new class called BouncingBall. The BouncingBall should paint a circle that bounces all around the screen (moving in both x and y axis).

When the ball hits a wall it should bounce and change its speed (x or y, depending on which wall was hit)

Create some bouncing balls to join our rectangles
