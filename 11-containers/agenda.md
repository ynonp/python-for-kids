# Homework Revisited

1. Print all the prime numbers up until 30 (or any other arbitrary number).

   Building blocks: variables, print, while loop, nested loops, if, functions (not mandatory)

# Data Structures Introduction

1. We became familiar with variables, assigning to them, incrementing/decrementing them
   and ultimately reading their values.
   
2. But what if we want to store multiple objects together?
   For example, the list of groceries to buy for recalling it later in the supermarket.
   One variable at a time will be tedious.

3. One of the most basic types in any programming language is a list. In python we declare
   a list simply by assigning into a variable the list like groceries = ['milk', 'bread', 'cornflakes'].

4. What operations do you think one can do on list? Experiment with 3 and print the resulting list(s).
   Mind that you can just use the '.' after the list name to see the functions you can invoke.

5. Why is list-sorting-failed.py not working? 

# Python Dictionaries

1. Often we want to be able to pick a record out of a huge database. Imagine the list of banks accounts or
   citizens of Israel. When the teller looks at our account or when the ministry of interior
   pulls up our "file" - they cannot possibly do it one by one.

2. How are records pulled "so fast"? Hashing and/or sorting - but we will not delve into the math for now.
   How many guesses can Yotam guarantee to find a number between 1 and X?

3. Python's dict() is the implementation of such a fast key access data structure.
   Let's write a program that supports listing the students in class, deleting a student,
   adding a student, checking whether a student is in the class, etc.

# Debugging Session

1. Use the debugger for the development of the program above.
